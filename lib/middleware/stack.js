/**
 * A middleware is an object that implements any of the following methods:
 *
 * request(req, arg2, arg3, callback)
 * response(req, err, res1, res2, callback)
 *
 * A middleware is free to alter req and update/replace any of arg2, arg3, err,
 * res1 or res2. Multiple middlewares can be chained together forming a
 * middleware stack. The callback is used to pass the control to the next
 * middleware in chain. For example, a noop middleware can look like this:
 *
 * var noop = {
 *     'request': function(req, arg2, arg3, callback) {
 *         callback(arg2, arg3);
 *     },
 *     'response': function(req, err, res1, res2, callback) {
 *         callback(err, res1, res2);
 *     }
 * };
 *
 * Given two middlewares m1 and m2 and the middleware stack defined as:
 *
 * MiddlewareStack([m1, m2]).run(req, arg2, arg3, handler, handler_callback)
 *
 * The order in which the middlewares are applied in is: m1.request->
 * m2.request-> handler-> m2.response-> m1.response-> handler_callback.
 *
 * The difference between applying a middleware stack to the server and the
 * client is the logical direction a request and a response point to. For
 * example, for a server it looks like this: server<-request, server->response;
 * while for a client it's the reverse: client->request, client<-response.
